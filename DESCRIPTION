Description: The package contains locations of agricultural settlements near
    the village of Tortosa (Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain) in two different
    historical periods and of indigenous societies settled on the Cambaceres
    bay area (Beagle Channel, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina) previous to the
    arrival of European expeditions. Functions for cost-based analysis of
    settlement clustering are included. Two vignettes are included to reproduce
    results from Negre et al. (2017).
